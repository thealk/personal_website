      <description>It’s been just about a week since the Speech-Language and Audiology Canada (SAC) Conference.

      <description>This past Tuesday we had our second R-Ladies #LdnOnt meet up of the year. The topic was using R Markdown to generate summary reports and manuscripts, led by yours truly.

      <description>R-Ladies, #LdnOnt just recently celebrated its one-year anniversary 🎉. As such, I thought it time to share my thoughts on the community we’ve found and the things we’ve learned. In case reading through a post of ramblings isn’t your style/you ain’t got time for that, here are some key learnings:
tl;dr:  👊 If you are thinking of starting up a similar group, don’t let the mind games get you down!</description>
