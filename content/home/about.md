# About me

I am a candidate in the [combined MClSc/PhD](http://www.uwo.ca/fhs/csd/programs/combined.html) in Communication Sciences & Disorders (Speech-Language Pathology) at [Western University](http://uwo.ca/) in London, Ontario. My research focuses on describing the acoustic-phonetic characteristics of dysarthria, a group of motor speech disorders. In particular, I am interested in how changes in the acoustic speech signal modulate *speech intelligibility*, that is, how understandable one's speech is to a typical listener. Informed by my background in linguistics and speech acoustics, my research can broadly be categorized into three themes: 

1. Understanding variable and adverse treatment effects on speech intelligibility
2. Acoustic distinctiveness and its role in speech intelligibliity
3. The use of technology for speech measurement and treatment

While much of my research has focused on hypokinetic dysarthria, a motor speech disorder associated with Parkinson's disease, I am also interested in the differential speech processes in younger and older healthy adults, as well as individuals with cerebellar damage.
