# Biography

I'm in the fourth year of a combined MClSc/PhD in Health & Rehabilitation Sciences at Western University in London, Ontario. I specialize in Speech & Language Sciences and Speech-Language Pathology.

My research focuses on describing the acoustic-phonetic characteristics of dysarthria, a group of motor speech disorders. In particular, much of my research is centred on hypokinetic dysarthria, which is associated with Parkinson's disease. In particular, I study how behavioural, pharmaceutical, and surgical interventions for Parkinson's disease lead to changes in the acoustic speech signal, and how these changes modulate a typical listener's ability to understand the spoken utterance.
