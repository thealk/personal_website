# R-Ladies \#LdnOnt

[R-Ladies](http://www.rladies.org) is a global initiative with the mission of promoting gender diversity in the statistical programming community, R. Local chapters exist in cities all over the world, with the London, Ontario (#LdnOnt) chapter joining the team in January 2017.

While my original intention was to simply join a nearby chapter, it turned out "nearby" was not really a feasible criterion, the closest being about 6 hours away. Fortunately, the R-Ladies team is an enthusiastic bunch with great online support to facilitate the start up of new chapters and thus, with the collaboration of a friend, R-Ladies #LdnOnt was born.

Our group meets monthly to feature tutorials, exercises, co-working space, and a dynamic but informal space to share resources and learn. To hear about our upcoming events or get more information about the group, check out our [MeetUp page](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-ldnont/).
