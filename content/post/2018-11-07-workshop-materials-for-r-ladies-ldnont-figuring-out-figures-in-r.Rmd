I gave an intro workshop on ggplot ("Figuring out Figures in R") for our R-Ladies #LdnOnt crew at the end of October. Those materials are online now in various forms:

- [The slides themselves](https://rladiesldnont.netlify.com/slides/ggplot_workshop#1)
- [Github repo](https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_london_ontario/tree/master/2018-10-25_ggplot) containing the source code to the slides, the data, and an .R script including some of the code we played around with
- [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jNOtDwK8NK2wVRtNx-a2IvSw0ZhgBdex?usp=drive_open) containing everything you can find at our GitHub (trying to be cross-platform friendly, here!)

This was a fun workshop to give because, to an extent, it is something I am fairly familiar with (I have plotted many a graph in ggplot), but there are still lots of unknowns to me. I'm exploring some new formats for visualization (e.g., I'm getting really stoked about [joyplots](https://github.com/clauswilke/ggridges)[^1], aka ridgeplots lately for my dissertation) that I wanted an excuse to explore more in depth. There are a number of aspects of ggplot I have to look up

*literally* `r emo::ji("clap")` *every* `r emo::ji("clap")` *time* `r emo::ji("clap")` *I* `r emo::ji("clap")` *use* `r emo::ji("clap")` *it*

(cough, [`theme()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html), cough), and I wanted a good reference I could refer back to for that. I'd also been wanting to try out creating presentations in  [`xaringan`](https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1), and so I used this workshop as an excuse to get my hands dirty with that too.

That's pretty much all I have to say! I am truncating my tendancy to turn these little "updates" into long rambly posts because there are a number of other things on my to-do list today, and it's too easy to get carried away writing about R-Ladies fun shenanigans.
