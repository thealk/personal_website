<p>I gave an intro workshop on ggplot (“Figuring out Figures in R”) for our R-Ladies #LdnOnt crew at the end of October. Those materials are online now in various forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://rladiesldnont.netlify.com/slides/ggplot_workshop#1">The slides themselves</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_london_ontario/tree/master/2018-10-25_ggplot">Github repo</a> containing the source code to the slides, the data, and an .R script including some of the code we played around with</li>
<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jNOtDwK8NK2wVRtNx-a2IvSw0ZhgBdex?usp=drive_open">Google Drive folder</a> containing everything you can find at our GitHub (trying to be cross-platform friendly, here!)</li>
</ul>
<p>This was a fun workshop to give because, to an extent, it is something I am fairly familiar with (I have plotted many a graph in ggplot), but there are still lots of unknowns to me. I’m exploring some new formats for visualization (e.g., I’m getting really stoked about <a href="https://github.com/clauswilke/ggridges">joyplots</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, aka ridgeplots lately for my dissertation) that I wanted an excuse to explore more in depth. There are a number of aspects of ggplot I have to look up</p>
<p><em>literally</em> 👏 <em>every</em> 👏 <em>time</em> 👏 <em>I</em> 👏 <em>use</em> 👏 <em>it</em></p>
<p>(cough, <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html"><code>theme()</code></a>, cough), and I wanted a good reference I could refer back to for that. I’d also been wanting to try out creating presentations in <a href="https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1"><code>xaringan</code></a>, and so I used this workshop as an excuse to get my hands dirty with that too.</p>
<p>That’s pretty much all I have to say! I am truncating my tendancy to turn these little “updates” into long rambly posts because there are a number of other things on my to-do list today, and it’s too easy to get carried away writing about R-Ladies fun shenanigans.</p>
