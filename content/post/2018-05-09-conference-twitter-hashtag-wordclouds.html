<!-- It's been just about a week since the Speech-Language and Audiology Canada (SAC) Conference wrapped up in Edmonton. It marks the furthest west I've travelled in Canada thus far (I know, I know, I've been here a decade). It's been a hefty few months of travel, with trips to conferences, talks, and family visits sprinkled throughout. Back in Ontario now for at least the next two months straight, I finally have time to sink back into projects that fare better when they have my full attention for days on end, but, have of course now introduced new distractions into my routine.  -->
<p>It‚Äôs been just about a week since the <a href="https://www.sac-oac.ca/welcome">Speech-Language and Audiology Canada (SAC) Conference</a>. Clinical researchers in speech-pathology and audiology from all across Canada came to take part in three days of talks, poster presentations, product demos, and planning meetings. Because the conference is so large, there tend to be several overlapping sessions at once. There‚Äôs pretty much something there for everyone, but there‚Äôs also a good chance that you‚Äôll be torn between attending two sessions that overlap and have to choose one. Fortunately, the SLP crowd is a twitterful bunch, and are quick to update other SLPeeps near and far on professional tidbits they find of interest.</p>

<p><a href="#wordcloud"><em>Cool story. But I‚Äôm just here for the word cloud‚Ä¶ bring me to the word cloud.</em></a></p>
</center>
<p>I am admittedly a novice tweeter/twitterer/person who uses twitter. There‚Äôs a lot of pressure to be clever and impactful in 140 (nay, now 280) characters. My fear of misconjugating the verb ‚Äúto tweet‚Äù also may have some bearing on my reluctance. This is not a baseless fear; an unfortunate incident in my early twitter days led me to accidentally calling a dear friend a terrible name in a poor attempt at the past tense. Still unsure TBH ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but I have learned I am not entirely alone.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Reluctantly, I have taken another stab at it this past year, prompted by needing to familiarize myself with it for R-Ladies. All the cool girls have it and it is a quasi-requisite for being fully connected with the community. I have since realized though (and actual twitter die-hards could tell you they‚Äôve been saying this for years) it turns out to be a great toy/tool to stay connected with the academic community, as well as within the clinical SLP world. Many journals tweet out recently published articles. Researchers have lengthy debates and exchanges of ideas. Clinicians post queries, findings, and blogs. And, the topic relevant to this particular post, academic conference attendees can document their experiences to the great wide interwebs with the use of conference hashtags.</p>
<div id="goal-generate-a-word-cloud-from-sacconf-tweets" class="section level1">
<h1>Goal: Generate a word cloud from #SACConf tweets</h1>
<p>A few considerations to bear in mind before forging ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>While there are many fun text-based analyses one can do with twitter scraping, I know very little to absolutely nothing about that. If you‚Äôre into that though, check out the many blog posts that have referenced <code>rtweet</code> to see what people have come up with.</li>
<li>There are <a href="http://www.followthehashtag.com/features/word-cloud/">apps in existence</a> that will execute this goal for you, but that is besides the point.</li>
<li>There used to be a nifty way to compile tweets using <a href="https://storify.com/">Storify</a>, but this won‚Äôt be possible after May 16, 2018. Fortunately, Ma√´lle Salmon wrote an <a href="http://www.masalmon.eu/2018/03/24/satrdaycapetown/">equally nifty post</a> on how to do just that using <code>rtweet</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming there‚Äôs an agreed-upon communal hashtag for a given conference, this is a fairly quick and painless fun little task. In the case of the SAC Conference, the hashtag stays the same year to year: #SACConf. If, however, something like #MSC16 turns out not to be the 2016 Motor Speech Conference and instead is flooded with tweets from the Manufacturing Supply Chain annual meeting, things can get hairy (as was once narrowly avoided at what became #motorspeech16). It also helps if several distinct voices are tweeting about the same thing.</p>
</div>
<div id="authorization-in-twitter" class="section level1">
<h1>Authorization in Twitter</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://rtweet.info/index.html">rtweet</a> package allows us to search tweets and pull them into a data frame in R. In order to use the package to query Twitter‚Äôs API, you first need a twitter account (passive twitterer? No problem.). Then you need to authorize <code>rtweet</code> via your account. You‚Äôll be prompted to log in to Twitter the first time you try to use one of the query functions to get tweets. Do what it says and you‚Äôll be good to go! If you find yourself not good to go, you may need to do some additional hackery involving secret API keys and other less whimsical ingredients as described <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtweet/vignettes/auth.html">here</a>. Godspeed.</p>
</div>
<div id="accessing-tweets" class="section level1">
<h1>Accessing tweets</h1>
<p>In this case we‚Äôre looking at a finite number of tweets tagged with #SACConf (not case sensitive), so we‚Äôre interested in collecting <em>all</em> of them. You could also specifiy a maximum number and/or whether you want <em>recent</em> or <em>popular</em> tweets. A couple of days after the conference had ended, this is what I entered:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rtweet)
library(knitr)

tweets &lt;- search_tweets(&quot;#sacconf&quot;, lang=&quot;en&quot;,include_rts = FALSE)
head(tweets$text)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## NULL</code></pre>
<p>Timing is <em>crucial</em> here if you‚Äôre chasing hashtags, though, so be cautious.</p>

<p>Sadly/unsurprisingly, Twitter Co. is a clever money-making machine and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41543179/retrieve-twitter-old-tweet-using-r">doesn‚Äôt actually let you access old Twitter API queries without a cost</a> (either financially or through a lot of hacking). That is, you can access <em>recent</em> tweets for free, but you gotta pay up if you want to access tweets earlier than the last week or so. You can purchase the option to go back in time, but given I stopped even getting guacamole on my burritos when the price went up a whopping 87 cents there was absolutely zero chance of that happening for me. You are limited to <strong>NINE DAYS</strong> of queries so you‚Äôve got to be quick! By the time this post actually makes it to the web, I can almost guarantee that it will have been more than 9 days from the critical start time that I wanted the tweets from, so FEAR NOT - there is some hope for the lazy like me‚Ä¶ sort of. If you know the critical 9-day period for your tweets of interest is closing in, you can do a quick scrape, save the results to an .RData file, and load that in to analyze/wordcloudize later.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Save tweets for later (and note when saved):
save(tweets, file=&quot;sacconf_tweets.RData&quot;)

# And access them later at will...
# load(&quot;sacconf_tweets.RData&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Note that if you go this route, you don‚Äôt have to use <code>search_tweets</code> again (and in fact if you do and you‚Äôre past the 9 day window you‚Äôll get a very different sample/nothing).</p>
<p>If you miss that 9-day window though, tough cookies <em>if</em> you wanted tweets from a general query. If you‚Äôre only interested in particular individuals‚Äô tweets, however, you‚Äôre in luck: you can access a single twitterer‚Äôs entire timeline without restriction (so, for example, one could pull all the tweets from <span class="citation">@wespeechies</span> at any time).</p>
</div>
<div id="when-was-the-action-happening" class="section level2">
<h2>When was the action happening?</h2>
<p>Now that we‚Äôve got our tweets, we can see when most of the tweeting action was happening by plotting the density of the time stamp of the post (the <code>created_at</code> variable). This can help confirm that you‚Äôve got the right timeframe and that the tweet schedules matches your expectations for that time frame. There were 131 tweets in total during the time period I queried.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)

ggplot(tweets, aes(created_at))+
     geom_density(alpha=.75, fill=&quot;#4CABDA&quot;)+ # fill with main SAC logo blue
     ggtitle(&quot;#SACConf Tweets&quot;)+
     ylab(&quot;Density&quot;)+
     xlab(&quot;Time of tweet&quot;)+
     theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill=&quot;#96AAB5&quot;),
           title = element_text(color=&quot;#F09240&quot;, size=20)) # background and text colour also from SAC Conference logo</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2018-05-09-conference-twitter-hashtag-wordclouds_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>There‚Äôs a peak at the end of the first day of talks (May 3) and a flurry of activity at the end of the conference.</p>

<div id="making-the-word-cloud" class="section level1">
<h1>Making the word cloud</h1>
<div id="tidying-the-word-list" class="section level2">
<h2>Tidying the word list</h2>
<p>Now we have to check to make sure the top appearing words are relevant and informative. For the sake of language, I do love my function words, but the appearance of ‚Äúthe‚Äù and ‚Äúa‚Äù in a word cloud does little to conjure up the spirit of the tweets. We‚Äôll first eliminate basic function words using the <code>stopwords</code> corpus from the <a href="https://github.com/dariusk/corpora"><code>rcorpora</code></a> package (thanks again Ma√´lle for the <a href="http://www.masalmon.eu/2017/02/28/rbloggerstweets/">how-to</a>).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rcorpora)
library(tidytext)
library(dplyr)

stopwords &lt;- corpora(&quot;words/stopwords/en&quot;)$stopWords
tweets_words &lt;- tweets %&gt;%
     unnest_tokens(word, text) %&gt;%
     count(word, sort=TRUE) %&gt;%
     filter(!word %in% stopwords)</code></pre>
<p>Looking at just the top ten words gives some indication that there may still be strings we don‚Äôt want. ‚Äúhttps‚Äù and ‚Äút.co‚Äù for instance don‚Äôt make the cut. ‚Äúsacconf‚Äù understandably occurs much more frequently than the other words (it appears in every tweet because it was the search term), but we‚Äôll deal with that in a minute.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(head(tweets_words, n=10), aes(x=reorder(word, -n), y=n))+
     geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;)+
     ggtitle(&quot;Top 10 words in #SACConf tweets: First pass&quot;)+
     theme(axis.text=element_text(size=14, angle = 90, face=&quot;bold&quot;), axis.title.x = element_blank(), title = element_text(size=14))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2018-05-09-conference-twitter-hashtag-wordclouds_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>After looking at the top 100 words, I‚Äôve made a few additional cuts. I debated cutting people‚Äôs names but have left them in for now - there are certain names that received substantial attention and it‚Äôs informative to leave them in.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Remove some more uninformative words

tweets_words &lt;- tweets_words %&gt;%
     filter(!word %in% c(&quot;t.co&quot;, &quot;https&quot;, &quot;00&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;p.m&quot;, &quot;download&quot;, &quot;rt&quot;, &quot;gt&quot;, &quot;dr&quot;))</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="customizing-your-cloud" class="section level2">
<h2>Customizing your cloud</h2>
<p>When I originally sat down to do this, I planned on using the <code>wordcloud</code> package because a) it seemed pretty relevant and b) <a href="https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/find-out-what-celebrities-tweet-about-the-most-1">I found this handy tutorial</a> on another blog. After a bit of digging and playing around though, I decided to go with <a href="https://github.com/Lchiffon/wordcloud2"><code>wordcloud2</code></a> because it had a few more <a href="https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/the-wordcloud2-library/">fun features</a> to exploit.</p>
<p>All you really need to generate a word cloud at this point is</p>
<pre class="r"><code>`wordcloud2(data = tweets_words)</code></pre>
<p>but I‚Äôve made a few extra tweaks in the version below. Word size, unless otherwise specified, is dictated by the number of occurrences. Since the entry ‚Äúsacconf‚Äù appears once for every tweet (since it was the word used to scrape the tweets in the first place), it shows up waaaaay more often than all the other words. I want to keep it in, but don‚Äôt want it dominating the scene quite so much, so I‚Äôll resize it. I‚Äôll also change the colour scheme to match the <a href="https://www.sac-oac.ca/welcome">SAC Conference logo</a>, add a black background, set the rotation of the words, and filter out words that appear less than five times.</p>
</div>
<div id="wordcloud" class="section level2">

<h3>Bonus! #motorspeech18</h3>
<p>I also logged tweets after the Motor Speech Conference this February. There are admittedly fewer motor speechies in the twittersphere (solid shout out to Tricia McCabe for expertly holding down the fort as the rest of us tried to keep up). While there was a higher tweets-to-tweeter than for #SACConf, I think the end result still winds up being fairly representative and a fun contrast. No code displayed here, but basically the same setup<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

<p>C‚Äôest tout! A fun little exercise in visualizing the most popular words used to tweet out sound bites from a conference. This would be easily generalizable to other twitter trends of interest, just bearing in mind that you either need to a) keep in mind the 9 day limit or b) choose one (or a subset of) individuals to scrape tweets from.</p>
